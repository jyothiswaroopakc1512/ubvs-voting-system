# Universal Biometric Voting System (UBVS)

**“Vote Smart. Vote Secure. Vote Biometric.”**

---

## Overview

The **Universal Biometric Voting System (UBVS)** is a secure web-based voting platform designed to ensure **every citizen can exercise their voting rights—regardless of physical location**.

Voters who are away from their home state—such as **students**, **working professionals**, or **elderly citizens living with family**—often miss elections due to travel constraints. UBVS solves this by enabling **remote voting from any government-authorized location**, secured with **biometric verification** and **officer-assisted authentication**.

---

## Key Features

* **Biometric Authentication** for voter identity
* **Local Voting** with single biometric verification
* **Global Voting** with dual authentication (voter + officer)
* **Real-Time Biometric Matching** using SQLite + SQLAlchemy
* **Officer and Voter Registration Portals**
* **Simple, accessible web interface** via Flask
* **Secure database** and modular backend architecture

---

## Problem Solved

* Citizens often miss voting due to travel, age, or accessibility
* Existing systems lack **remote biometric voting** capability
* **UBVS enables secure voting from any location**, increasing participation

> *Example:* A voter from Andhra Pradesh currently studying in Chennai can vote from Chennai itself without traveling back to their hometown.

| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**        | Python Flask                                                         |
| **ORM & DB**       | SQLAlchemy + SQLite                                                  |
| **Frontend**       | HTML + Jinja2 Templates                                              |
| **Authentication** | Fingerprint Biometric (simulated), Officer Verification              |
| **Deployment**     | Localhost (can be adapted for cloud or official government networks) |

## Software Design Principles Used

* **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** – Modular code structure
* **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)** – Easily extensible for new biometric devices
* **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Shared abstractions for reusable logic
* **OOP Concepts** – Classes for User, Device, Authentication, etc.

## How It Works

1. **Voter Registration**

   * Aadhar number, date of birth, biometric, address, etc.

2. **Officer Registration**

   * Employee ID, Aadhar number, and biometric verification

3. **Local Voting**

   * Voter logs in and authenticates using biometric → casts vote

4. **Global Voting**

   * Voter logs in with biometric
   * Nearby officer re-authenticates using their biometric
   * Once dual authentication is verified → vote is allowed

5. **Vote is securely recorded in the database**
