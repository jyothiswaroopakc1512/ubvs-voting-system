**Universal Biometric Voting System (UBVS)**
Designed and developed a secure, dual-authentication biometric voting system that enables citizens to cast votes both locally and remotely, irrespective of their current geographic location. The system is especially beneficial for students, professionals, and elderly individuals residing away from their native polling stations.
It incorporates fingerprint-based voter identification integrated with a secure database, and implements two voting modes:

1. **Local Voting** – simple biometric verification.
2. **Global Voting** – dual authentication using both the voter’s biometric and a local officer’s biometric.

The platform is built using Python Flask with SQLAlchemy and SQLite, featuring a web interface for voter registration, officer enrollment, secure login, and real-time vote casting. This project not only promotes democratic participation by addressing voter inaccessibility but also demonstrates practical implementation of secure software architecture principles like SRP, OCP, and DRY.

# 🗳️ Universal Biometric Voting System (UBVS)

### 🔐 “Vote Smart. Vote Secure. Vote Biometric.”

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Universal Biometric Voting System (UBVS)** is a secure web-based voting platform designed to ensure every citizen can exercise their voting rights—**regardless of their physical location**.

Voters who are away from their home state—such as students, professionals, or the elderly living with family—often miss elections due to travel limitations. UBVS solves this problem by enabling **remote voting from any government-authorized location**, secured through biometric verification and officer-assisted authentication.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* ✅ **Biometric Authentication** for voter identity
* ✅ **Local Voting** with single biometric verification
* ✅ **Global Voting** with **dual-authentication** (voter + officer)
* ✅ **Real-Time Biometric Matching** using SQLite + SQLAlchemy
* ✅ Officer and Voter **Registration Portals**
* ✅ Simple, accessible **web interface** via Flask
* ✅ Secure database and modular backend architecture

---

## 🧠 Problem Solved

* ❌ Many citizens can't vote due to travel, age, or lack of access
* ❌ Existing systems lack **remote biometric voting**
* ✅ UBVS allows **anyone to vote from anywhere**, securely

> For example: A voter from Andhra Pradesh living in Chennai for education can now cast their vote from Chennai itself, without returning to their hometown.

## 🧱 System Design Principles Used

* **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** – Modular code structure
* **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)** – Easily extensible for new biometrics
* **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Abstractions for repeated logic
* **OOP Concepts** – Classes for Users, Devices, Authentication

## 🔑 How It Works

1. **Voter registers** with Aadhar, DOB, biometric, etc.
2. **Officer registers** separately with employee ID.
3. **Local Voting**: voter logs in with biometric and votes.
4. **Global Voting**: voter logs in with biometric → nearby officer authenticates again → voting allowed.
5. **Vote is cast and stored securely.**
